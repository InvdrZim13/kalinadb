    "desc": "A female occultist from the 19th Century, a founder of theosophy. Despite having married young to a Russian aristocrat, she soon eloped and then lived gorgeously in the magic world. Popularly known as Madame Blavatsky. She is considered to have immersed herself on mysticism out of belief in the existence of the Lemurian continent, eventually coming in contact with a higher existence ?Mahatma? and its collective body ?Hierarchy?, acquiring many wisdoms in the process. If that is indeed the case, she might have caught a glimpse of a possibility towards the Root.",
